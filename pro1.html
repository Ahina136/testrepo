                                <p class="para">Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical developmen
                                    t establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation. His career started with him designing a
                                     small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was 
                                     transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first satellite vehicle launch.
                                      The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam
                                       received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed two projects like Project
                                        Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the successful SLV program's
                                         technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought
                                     secret funds for these aerospace projects. His research and immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.


                                    Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 and served at the same 
                                    post for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal scientific advisor to the government.
                                     His immense role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power. Kamal had
                                      now become a national hero, to be remembered for ages to come. However, the tests he conducted caused a huge
                                       uproar in the international community. Kamal put forward a nationwide plan called Technology Vision 2020,
                                        which according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature of India in 20 years, taking it
                                         from a developing to a developed nation. The plan envisioned the progress of the nation by adopting advanced
                                          technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing the education of the masses.</p><br>
